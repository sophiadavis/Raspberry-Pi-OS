This is my work for the University of Cambridge's course [Baking Pi -- Operating Systems Development](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html). The syllabus walks through building a basic OS from scratch in ARM assembly. The OS runs will run on a Raspberry Pi (the course is designed for the Model B, but will run on a B+).

To run, insert an SD card into your computer, <code>make</code>, eject the card, and plug in to the pi. As of (this commit), the activitiy LED should flash an SOS pattern.
